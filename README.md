Ello, Iâ€™m Sillybutts.


I make stuff, go print it. Unless it's something I made that isn't 3d printed. Do whatever is applicable in that case. 

If you wish to print and sell any of my Non-Commercial designs, please contact me for licensing. 
I can be reached on 
- Discord (Sillybutts#5905) 
- or Reddit (u/SillyTheGamer).
Take note that not *all* of my designs are NC, just some of them. 

**If you are having issues with any of my designs, let me know on Discord (Sillybutts#5905) or Reddit (u/SillyTheGamer).**

Here's some other links to my crap:

- I put my printables on Thingiverse (https://www.thingiverse.com/sillybutts/designs), but that site sucks, so my Thingi stuff is also here on GitHub.

- This is my YouTube channel, I put a bunch of stuff on it. Gaming videos, 3d modeling, test prints, etc. https://www.youtube.com/c/Sillybutts/videos

- This is my Reddit https://www.reddit.com/user/SillyTheGamer
