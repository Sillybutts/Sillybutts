Ello, Iâ€™m Sillybutts.


I make stuff, go print it. Unless it's something I made that isn't 3d printed. Do whatever is applicable in that case. 

If you want to support what I do, go buy stuff at my RedBubble! https://www.redbubble.com/people/Sillybutts/shop

I put my printables on Thingiverse (https://www.thingiverse.com/sillybutts/designs), but that site sucks. So my stuff is also here on GitHub.

If you wish to print and sell any of my Non-Commercial designs, please contact me for licensing. I can be reached on Discord (Sillybutts#5905) or on Reddit (u/SillyTheGamer). Take note that not *all* of my designs are NC, just some of them. 

This is my YouTube channel, I put a bunch of stuff on it. Gaming videos, 3d modeling, test prints, etc. https://www.youtube.com/c/Sillybutts/videos
